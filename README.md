# How to build games

## What is this?

This is a response to a very reasonable question:

"If I learn this, can I make games?"

or, similarly:

"If I want to make this type of game, what do I need to know?"

## Rationale

This repo was borne out of a Code Club session where ever other attendee
asked one of the two questions above.

It's a good question!

The answer, unfortunately, as with a lot of things in the real world, is a
lot more complicated.

Hence, this repo.

## Goals

Ideally, we can visualize, for every type of game, ranging from the simplistic,
like a coin-toss, a guessing game, rock-paper-scissors; to the complexities of
an MMORPG or a high-definition, ultra-realistic multiplayer game with lag compensation, and plot a set of dependent skill-sets that are needed to produce meaningful outcomes.

Hence: we should be able to visualize this as a directed graph.

This assumes you know what a directed graph is, which totally meta, but hey.
